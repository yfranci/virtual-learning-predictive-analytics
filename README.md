# Predictive Analytics in Virtual Learning: Machine Learning Approaches to Enhance Student Success and Retention in Higher Education
This study explores the application of machine learning techniques to predict academic success and dropout rates among higher education students using Virtual Learning Environments. Utilizing three distinct datasets—the first focusing on student performance evaluation, the second on predicting student dropout, and the third on student interaction with virtual learning environments—we implement and analyze three machine learning classifiers: Random Forest, Decision Trees, and Bagging. Our objective is to identify significant predictors of student success and dropout, enabling educational institutions to devise targeted interventions. The study provides insights into the efficacy of different classifiers in educational data analysis and underscores the potential of machine learning in fostering student success.
