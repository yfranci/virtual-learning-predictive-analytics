# Predictive Analytics in Virtual Learning: Machine Learning Approaches to Enhance Student Success and Retention in Higher Education

##Overview
This repository contains datasets and code for the study "Predictive Analytics in Virtual Learning: Machine Learning Approaches to Enhance Student Success and Retention in Higher Education". The study applies machine learning techniques to predict academic success and dropout rates among higher education students.

## Contents
1. Datasets: Two datasets used in the study:
   - Student Performance Evaluation
   - Predicting Student Dropout
3. Code: Jupyter Notebook (StudentSuccessPredictor_Analysis.ipynb) detailing the implementation of machine learning classifiers.

## Machine Learning Classifiers
- Random Forest
- Decision Trees
- Bagging

##Objectives
1. To apply and evaluate the effectiveness of the classifiers in predicting academic performance and dropout rates.
2. To identify key determinants of academic success and dropout.
   
## How to Use
- Explore the Datasets: Understand the structure and content of the datasets.
- Run the Code: Execute the Jupyter Notebook to replicate the study's findings or to apply the classifiers to similar problems.

## Requirements
- Python 3
- Relevant Python libraries (as listed in the Jupyter Notebook)
